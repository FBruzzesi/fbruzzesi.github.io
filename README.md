# One commit at a time - Personal Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog, which is hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-page].

The blog is built using [mkdocs][mkdocs], [mkdocs-material][mkdocs-material] theme and the [blog plugin][blog-plugin].

## Why does this blog exist?

I wrote about it in my first post, [Hello World][hello-world]. In extreme synthesis, the TL;DR would go something like:

> I wanted to have a place to write about things I learn and experience, mostly regarding my work (programming) life.
