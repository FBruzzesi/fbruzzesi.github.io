# üëã Hi there, I'm Francesco
  
## ‚ùóDisclaimer

All the opinions on this blog are solely my own and do not represent the view of my employers, current nor previous.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who am I?

I hate to describe myself with a generic title - it may sound clich√®, yet I am a curious mind and a passionate learner.

I fell in love with mathematics in my early years, I can remember counting and adding numbers at 4 or 5: mathematics and logic reasoning have been a big part of my life ever since.

After pursuing a M.Sc. in pure mathematics at [ALGANT][algant], I decided not to pursue a PhD, but to move into industry to solve real-world problems through mathematical models and machine learning.

This was in the middle of 2018, and data science hype arrived in Italy as well (that's when you should know you are already late to the party üòÇ).

That was about the time I started to learn about data science and in late 2018 I started working as a data scientist, and I am still at it today.

## üíº Employer(s)

- Currently, I am a data scientist at [HelloFresh][hello-fresh] üçã in Berlin office.
- Previously I worked a senior data scientist at [Edison][edison]‚ö° one of the leading Italian electric utility company, under the [EDF group][edf]. Here I was involved maily on mid and down stream projects on tabular data, time series, anomaly detection, and optimization.
- My career started in a consulting company called [Avanade][avanade], a joint venture between Microsoft and Accenture, where I worked as a data engineer and data scientist on several projects for big clients in the telco, energy and automotive sectors.

## üíª Open Source

I am a big fan of open source, and I try to contribute to it as much as I can (which is not much, but I am trying to improve) to give back to the community.

Here is a list of open source projects I created (mostly for my own use and need but hopefully useful to others as well) and/or maintain:

- [iso-week-date][iso-week-date] is a toolkit to work with strings representing [ISO Week date][iso-week-wiki] in two formats: week **YYYY-WNN** and week date **YYYY-WNN-D**.
- [Timebasedcv][timebasedcv]: a python library that provides a cross validation strategy based on actual datetime values instead of indexes, of course compatible with scikit-learn cross validation API.
- [Compclasses][compclasses]: a python utility library to simplify *composition* (over inheritance).
- [Deczoo][deczoo]: a *zoo for python decorators*, a collection of decorators used on a daily basis.
- [scikit-lego][sklego]: A collection of lego bricks for scikit-learn pipelines. I am a contributor to this project and a maintainer since Sept 2023.

## üì´ How to reach me

The best way to reach out or connect with me is via [linkedin][my-linkedin]. I am always happy to connect with people and talk about data science, machine learning, mathematics, or anything else.
