# An Ode to Simplicity

<!-- more -->

In the first section of my resume (_Summary_) goes something like following:

> I tend to prefer **simple**, scalable and understandable solutions as opposed to overcomplex models when not necessary to bring value to the business.

I recently got to know that such a statement was the one that caught my current manager attention and made him decide to interview me in the first place.

In an era and a field where technological landscapes are evolving at an unprecedented pace, it's easy to get swept away by the allure of intricate frameworks, elaborate algorithms, and complex architectures.

However, the seasoned engineer should understand that simplicity is not merely a design choice; it's a philosophy that can transform the way we approach and solve problems.

## Simple does not mean easy

Let's start from the criticism stating that `simple==easy`, and why it is not true. We need to begin by defining what I mean by **simple** and why it is not a synonym of **easy**.

Simplicity is often misunderstood as an approach that takes less effort, cuts corners and avoids tackling the hard problems, namely easiness.

In reality, simplicity requires to understand a problem at his core essence and to deconstruct it into its fundamental components.

This doesn't imply avoiding complexity where it is necessary; rather, it means understanding the complexity and encapsulating it in a way that is manageable and comprehensible.

    Complexity is not the enemy

Simplicity gets overlooked because of two extremes:

- It is confused with easiness, and therefore it is seen as a synonym of laziness or not worth achieving.
- It is too hard to achieve, either due to incompetence or lack of time.

## The power of simplicity

Whenever starting a project, I always ask myself the following question:

**What's the simplest possible thing that might work? (1)**

1. From Joel Grus talk at Normconf: [What's the simplest possible thing that might work, and why didn't you try that first?][joel-grus-normconf]

This question encapsulates the essence of simplicity in problem-solving. We should recognize that it is not uncommon that complexity arises from overengineering solutions or incorporating unnecessary features.

By consistently asking ourselves, "What is the simplest thing that might work?" we ensure that our solutions are both effective and efficient.

Simplicity is not a one-time decision but an ongoing commitment, iterative and incremental development process. By regularly revisiting the question of what constitutes the simplest working and scalable solution, we avoid unnecessary complexity and maintain a nimble and adaptive development approach.

## Pareto Principle

If you don't believe me, believe the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule.

The Pareto Principle, is a guiding principle that resonates deeply with the simplicity approach and mindset.

It postulates that, in many situations, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In the context of software development and data science, this principle encourages us to focus on the critical components that yield the most significant impact. i

It serves as a powerful tool for decision-making, guiding us to invest our energy where it matters most: such 20% is where it is most convenient to allocate time and resources.

Nevertheless it requires a key preliminary step: breaking down the problem complexity into its fundamental components and identifying the key features that drive the majority of value.

## Examples

### Data Science

### Software Development

### Web Development

### Daily Living

## Conclusion

Embracing simplicity is more than just a development methodology; it's a mindset that permeates our approach to problem-solving. I question myself about the necessity of complexity at every turn. Is there a simpler solution? Can we achieve the same results with fewer moving parts?

The pursuit of simplicity requires discipline and a commitment to constant refinement. It's about finding the delicate balance between innovation and pragmatism, pushing the boundaries of what's possible while staying grounded in the fundamentals that make our systems reliable and scalable.

In conclusion, simplicity is not a compromise; it's a strategic choice that empowers us to build resilient, efficient systems in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. 

We should celebrate the elegance that simplicity brings to our craft, ensuring that our solutions stand the test of time.
